          <ul>
            <li>Do not roleplay publicly as my characters</li>
            <li>Do not publish drawings of my characters in scenarios I would dislike (you may get the general idea <a href="https://derpibooru.org/filters/112134">from this filter</a>)</li>
            <li>Do not claim my characters as your own</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

      <p>Most of my characters are very meaningful to me, and sit in a special place in my heart. I'd love for them to bring you joy as well, but please be considerate to me, okay?</p>
