      <h1>Luna, aka Nighty Cloud</h1>
      <p>Artist, programmer, and many other things.</p>
      <h3><i className="fa fa-code"></i> Programmer</h3>
      <p>I've been coding since 2011, starting off with Garry's Mod Lua, trying my hand at game development with Unreal Engine, and ultimately moving on to web development. In 2017 I was invited to work on Derpibooru, an image hosting site dedicated to the My Little Pony cartoon, which caused my web development and sysadmin skills to skyrocket, turning me into a fairly competent systems administrator and web developer... hopefully. I'm experienced with Ruby, Lua, C (and coincidentally C++), as well as most of web dev stack (CSS, HTML, SQL, and such).</p>
      <p>Before web development, game development was my passion, and it still remains one of my "guilty pleasures". I've been coding some simple personal 2D games, drawing sprites and making silly stories. I've been looking to also get into VR game development, but have been postponing this plan until Source 2 SDK becomes available to the general public.</p>
      <h3><i className="fa fa-paint-brush"></i> Artist</h3>
      <p>I used to draw between 2014 and 2021. I mainly drew things related to the MLP and furry fandoms. Due to constant rejection, difficulties and disproportionate amounts of effort required from me, I have quit drawing until further notice.</p>
      <p>Art is a dead-end endeavor, and despite me absolutely loving the process of drawing, the lack of appreciation afterwards kills it for me. Additionally, in order for it to be any kind of money-making prospect, I would need to literally dedicate all of my life to it, which I cannot do, and even if I could, it would not pay the bills where I live.</p>
      <p>There are people who have liked my art, there are people who told me I am horrible at it and would never amount to anything. I'm tired of not progressing any further. In 8 years of my art experience, I have not gained any significant skill or following. I would rather not do it than keep listening to people who would just call me bad names, laugh at me and tell me to go away.</p>
      <h3><i className="fa fa-brain"></i> Personality</h3>
      <p>I am fairly introverted, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying a good conversation with my friends or really holding a discussion when I need to. I just have trouble making contact and getting to know new people. However, if I get into the right groove, I'll probably turn into a chatterbox and reveal all of my secrets to you on accident.</p>
      <p>I've always embraced change and tried new things with pleasure. If I don't know something, my first reaction is to find out more about it. If someone tells me something, I'd wish to find out why it is so. This curious attitude has allowed me to gain knowledge and experience which I otherwise may have missed. Over the years, I ended up picking up random hobbies like music making, writing, pottery, 3D modelling, and many more. I may not have gotten good at any of them, but I am grateful for all the fun I had, and it helped make my days more exciting.</p>
