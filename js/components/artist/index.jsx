      <h1><i className="fa fa-paint-brush"></i> Artist</h1>
      <p>I've been drawing since 2014, not being too consistent with my art, however trying my best to improve and learn new things, never refusing a challenge when it arose. My main motivation for art is to just make others happy, or otherwise bring you fun and enjoyment through my drawings!</p>
      <p>I mostly draw digitally using a drawing tablet, but I'm also quite proficient with drawing using regular pen and pencil, as well as markers. I often find myself sketching on whatever piece of paper is available to me while waiting on things.</p>
